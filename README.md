# Companion bot for Discord Integration

This folder continues a companion bot written in Node.js. It is completely optional but provides additional functionality for the core add-on.

Setup instructions are available here: https://nixfifty.com/knowledge-base/allowing-the-bot-to-appear-offline.2/

Note that support for the companion bot is limited due to the variance in server environments and configurations.
